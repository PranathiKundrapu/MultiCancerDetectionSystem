# Multi-Cancer Detection System

This project is a deep learning-based system for detecting **brain**, **lung**, and **breast** cancers from medical images. It uses a ResNet-50 CNN model with custom preprocessing and Focal Loss to improve classification performance.

## Project Overview

- Multi-class cancer detection (Brain, Lung, Breast)
- Binary classification for each: Cancerous / Non-Cancerous
- Custom image preprocessing and enhancement
- Model built on ResNet-50 architecture
- Flask-based frontend for predictions
